# Translate

## Rules for translation files

The reading and write back of the *.ini translation file will be nearly consistent.  

The following rules are used when handling *.ini files

- Keep comments
- Keep main translation file "en-GB" file line items order for other languages
- Not translated lines will be commented at start of line

## sub project types 
The program distingues between sub project types to 
match the different *.ini language files (types) with 
translation IDs for this type. 
This leads to reduced search as only files connected
to the type of Ãœ.ini file are included in the search

In general a project has one sub project type.
* modules
* plugins
* templates (Not tested yet)

Components have three sub project types
* backend
* backend-sys
* site

(1) Sub project: type backend

In the gray header the project name with sub project type is displayed.

Each subproject contains the main and translated files

(2) Source language file(s)
The source language file shows the existing translation IDs in a background of blue

- This file can not be changed.

It can be scrolled to compare orignal and translation on the same window

(3) Target language file(s)
The target language file shows the translation IDs as empty or already translated items.

- The order of translation items folow the lines in the main 'en-GB' file.
- Empty translations are prpended by a comment marker ";" in front.

The texts between "" can be changed and saved. Other parts of the line can be changed too.
For example the user can add comments behind or insert comment lines.

The comment marker ";" in front of not translated lines should be removed to active the translation. The configuration can be set to omit this automatic marker on emptytranslations
